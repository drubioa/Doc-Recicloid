@book{richardson_restful_2008,
	title = {{RESTful} Web Services},
	isbn = {9780596554606},
	abstract = {{"Every} developer working with the Web needs to read this book." -- David Heinemeier Hansson, creator of the Rails framework {"RESTful} Web Services finally provides a practical roadmap for constructing services that embrace the Web, instead of trying to route around it." -- Adam Trachtenberg, {PHP} author and {EBay} Web Services Evangelist You've built web sites that can be used by humans. But can you also build web sites that are usable by machines? That's where the future lies, and that's what {RESTful} Web Services shows you how to do. The World Wide Web is the most popular distributed application in history, and Web services and mashups have turned it into a powerful distributed computing platform. But today's web service technologies have lost sight of the simplicity that made the Web successful. They don't work like the Web, and they're missing out on its advantages. This book puts the {"Web"} back into web services. It shows how you can connect to the programmable web with the technologies you already use every day. The key is {REST}, the architectural style that drives the Web. This {book:Emphasizes} the power of basic Web technologies -- the {HTTP} application protocol, the {URI} naming standard, and the {XML} markup language Introduces the Resource-Oriented Architecture ({ROA)}, a common-sense set of rules for designing {RESTful} web services Shows how a {RESTful} design is simpler, more versatile, and more scalable than a design based on Remote Procedure Calls ({RPC)} Includes real-world examples of {RESTful} web services, like Amazon's Simple Storage Service and the Atom Publishing Protocol Discusses web service clients for popular programming languages Shows how to implement {RESTful} services in three popular frameworks -- Ruby on Rails, Restlet (for Java), and Django (for Python) Focuses on practical issues: how to design and implement {RESTful} web services and clients  This is the first book that applies the {REST} design philosophy to real web services. It sets down the best practices you need to make your design a success, and the techniques you need to turn your design into working code. You can harness the power of the Web for programmable applications: you just have to work with the Web instead of against it. This book shows you how.},

	isbn = {9781449358471},
	shorttitle = {Programming Android},
	abstract = {Get thoroughly up to speed on Android programming, and learn how to create up-to-date user experiences for both handsets and tablets. With this book’s extensively revised second edition, you’ll focus on Android tools and programming essentials, including best practices for using Android 4 {APIs.} If you’re experienced with Java or Objective-C, you’ll gain the knowledge necessary for building well-engineered applications. Programming Android is organized into four parts: Part One helps programmers with some Java or {iOS} experience get off to a fast start with the Android {SDK} and Android programming basics. Part Two delves into the Android framework, focusing on user interface and graphics class hierarchies, concurrency, and databases. It’s a solid foundation for understanding of how the most important parts of an Android application work. Part Three features code skeletons and patterns for accelerating the development of apps that use web data and Android 4 user interface conventions and {APIs.} Part Four delivers practical coverage of Android’s multimedia, search, location, sensor, and account {APIs}, plus the Native Development Kit, enabling developers to add advanced capabilities. This updated edition of Programming Android focuses on the knowledge and developer priorities that are essential for successful Android development projects.},
